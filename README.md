## Project

The aim is to reduce heavy quantum mechanical calculations of adsorption studies in surface physics. Chemical descriptor called Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) is used to find the fingerprint of each chemical environment of for the atoms, and atoms that have similar fingerprints that can be eliminated. By finding all the unique systems, we can avoid redundant quantum mechanical calculations.

## Code Example

Once installed, you can run ./runme, and 


## Motivation
Platinum Group Metals (PGMs) play an important role as catalytic materials
that can withstand high acidity, which is important in industry. They
are used for example in fuel cells and car filters.
Nevertheless,  recycling remains limited, while PGMs are increasingly adopted in emerging
new green energy technology, and studies indicate that presently known platinum reserves may last for only
15 years.

In order to substitute the expensive PGMs with inexpensive earth-abundant materials, we must rationally design
catalysts. However, due to the immense atom configuration space, it is too expensive to compute enough configurations
with current quantum mechanical computation methods and technology. This tool was developed to drastically decrease the
heavy quantum mechanical calculations by reducing redundant computations of adsorption sites.

## Installation

The code was written in C++ with Armadillo (http://arma.sourceforge.net/download.html) with version higher than 7. Once Armadillo 
is installed, ClusGeo2.0 in installed by simply running 'make' in the terminal. After ClusGeo2.0 is installed, it can be run by running './runme'.
