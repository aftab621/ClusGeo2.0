#1 Introduction
ClusGeo2.0 is a software designed for avoiding redundant DFT calculations for adsorption sites on a nano-cluster and
produce soap kernel for possible machine learning applications. The software can do the following.
1. Set up many hydrogens on the cluster surface between a minimum distance from the surface atoms to a maximum distance.
2. get soap spectrum on each surface atom.
3. get soap spectrum on every atom in the cluster.
4. get soap spectrum on every hydrogen after 1).
5. find unique surface atoms after 2)
6. find unique hydrogen sites after 4) 
7. set one hydrogen on top of each unique surface atom for further geometrical optimization of the hydrogen position.
